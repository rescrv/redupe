redupe
======

This package provides several command-line tools for dealing with backup and
longterm storage.  It uses forward error correction to make small errors or
bitflips easy to detect and correct.  Replication is still necessary to protect
against disaster or loss of data.

redupe:  Streaming tool that will add forward error correction in-line across
large blocks (~1MB) of the file.  The stream is not readable by the original
application and must be recovered using reundupe.  Prototypical use includes
reduping encrypted tarballs to ensure a single bitflip does not render them
irrecoverable.

fecsum:  Separable forward error correction.  This will create a standalone file
that, when coupled with the original file, can correct small errors in the
fecsum or the original.   Prototypical use includes creating a fecsum of large
media files that need some protection against corruption but also need to be
playable on-demand without creating a copy.
